(2) Brief Overview
	Neddit: Neddit is a web application based on Reddit. It will try to make some adjustments to how reddit is by using IBM Watson Analytics to produce a more user-favored page.
			By which it means it will analyze a user's history and determine his/her preference and create a more favorable front page that might intrigue a user in a better way.
			This will also allow a user-configured stylesheet dynamically (Think of duckduckgo's preferences). For d3 visualizations, this app will use convert any page into
			bubbles visualization.
			This is also our first web application, so we are not sure about if we can finish this within the timeframe, but will do our best to fulfill that. This will be using
			APIs from IBM Watson and also from Reddit.
